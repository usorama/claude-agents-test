# STORY-002: Implement payment processing with external gateway

## Story
As a customer, I want to process payments securely through multiple payment providers so that I can complete purchases with my preferred method.

## Technical Context
Key constraints: payment-service, webhook-handling, encryption

## Dependencies
- **Payment**: Requires payment processing and financial transaction handling (pending)
- **External Service**: Requires external service integration and API key management (pending)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Given valid payment details, when payment is processed, then transaction is completed
2. Given payment provider failure, when payment is attempted, then fallback provider is used
3. Given insufficient funds, when payment is processed, then appropriate error is returned
4. Given payment timeout, when processing, then user is notified and transaction is retried

## Test Scenarios
### Acceptance Test 1
- **Given**: valid payment details,
- **When**: payment is processed,
- **Then**: transaction is completed

### Acceptance Test 2
- **Given**: payment provider failure,
- **When**: payment is attempted,
- **Then**: fallback provider is used

### Acceptance Test 3
- **Given**: insufficient funds,
- **When**: payment is processed,
- **Then**: appropriate error is returned

### Acceptance Test 4
- **Given**: payment timeout,
- **When**: processing,
- **Then**: user is notified and transaction is retried

### Happy Path Test
- **Given**: Valid input and system state
- **When**: User performs the main action
- **Then**: Expected outcome is achieved

### Error Handling Test
- **Given**: Invalid input or error condition
- **When**: User attempts the action
- **Then**: Appropriate error message is displayed

## Implementation Hints
- Consider using batch processing for large datasets
- Implement progress tracking for long operations
- Add proper error recovery mechanisms
- Implement proper service boundaries
- Use message queuing for inter-service communication
- Write unit tests alongside implementation
- Document any new APIs or interfaces
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios
