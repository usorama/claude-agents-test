# BMAD-METHOD Claude Code PoC

This Proof of Concept validates the core assumptions for implementing BMAD-METHOD agents within Claude Code constraints.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd poc
npm install
npm start
```

## What This Tests

1. **Context Management**: File-based storage with locking
2. **Agent Architecture**: Base agent with Analyst implementation
3. **Orchestration**: Simple workflow execution
4. **Performance**: Token usage and timing metrics
5. **Integration Points**: Simulated Claude Code tools

## Results

The PoC demonstrates:
- ✅ Basic multi-agent coordination is feasible
- ✅ File-based context management works with proper locking
- ✅ Workflow orchestration can manage sequential tasks
- ⚠️ Token usage could be high with multiple agents
- ⚠️ File I/O may become bottleneck at scale

## Recommendation

**GO** - Proceed to Phase 1 with focus on:
1. Real Claude Code tool integration
2. Token usage optimization
3. Performance monitoring
4. Concurrent agent execution
