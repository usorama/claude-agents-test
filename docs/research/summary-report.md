### 3. **Deep Research on Claude Code Implementation** ✅
Created comprehensive research in `/docs/research/claude-code-implementation/`:

#### Research Documents Created:
1. **01-agent-architecture.md**
   - Agent identity and context management
   - Communication strategies
   - Tool system integration
   - Memory persistence

2. **02-required-agents-analysis.md**
   - All BMAD agents + 7 additional agents
   - Agent grouping strategies
   - Communication matrix
   - Resource requirements

3. **03-workflow-design.md**
   - Product development workflow (6 phases)
   - Monitoring and self-healing workflows
   - Operations & maintenance procedures
   - Emergency response protocols

4. **04-tmux-orchestration-integration.md**
   - Integration with Tmux-Orchestrator
   - Three-tier hierarchy mapping
   - Session management scripts
   - Persistent state handling

5. **05-context-management-strategy.md**
   - Hierarchical context model
   - JSON/YAML schemas for inter-agent communication
   - API contract management
   - Knowledge graph integration

6. **06-implementation-recommendations.md**
   - Task structure and file formats
   - Template organization
   - Tool requirements matrix
   - 5-phase implementation roadmap
   - Testing and validation framework

## Key Findings

### 1. **Agent System Architecture**
- BMAD agents map well to Claude Code through specialized system prompts
- File-based communication enables persistent context
- Tool system provides agent-specific capabilities

### 2. **Additional Agents Needed**
Beyond BMAD's 10 agents, 7 new agents are required:
- **Context Manager**: Central state and knowledge management
- **UI Architect**: Frontend architecture and component design
- **DevOps Engineer**: CI/CD and deployment automation
- **Git Manager**: Version control and collaboration
- **Monitor**: System health and performance tracking
- **Self-Healer**: Automatic issue resolution
- **Operations Manager**: Production environment management

### 3. **Workflow Requirements**
Four primary workflows cover the complete lifecycle:
- **Product Development**: Ideation → Deployment
- **Monitoring & Self-Healing**: Continuous system health
- **Operations & Maintenance**: Routine upkeep
- **Emergency Response**: Critical issue handling

### 4. **Context Management**
- Hierarchical model: Global → Project → Agent → Task
- Persistent storage in JSON/YAML formats
- API contracts for frontend/backend coordination
- Knowledge graph for complex relationships

### 5. **Implementation Strategy**
- Phase 1: Foundation (Context Manager, basic agents)
- Phase 2: Core Development (BMAD agents)
- Phase 3: Extended Capabilities (additional agents)
- Phase 4: Advanced Features (self-healing, monitoring)
- Phase 5: Production Ready (full integration)

## Next Steps

1. **Begin Implementation**
   - Start with Context Manager agent
   - Implement basic communication protocols
   - Set up Tmux orchestration environment

2. **Port BMAD Agents**
   - Adapt agent prompts for Claude Code
   - Implement tool requirements
   - Create agent-specific file structures

3. **Develop Extended Agents**
   - Build UI Architect and DevOps agents
   - Implement monitoring and self-healing
   - Create Git management workflows

4. **Integration Testing**
   - Test multi-agent coordination
   - Validate context sharing
   - Ensure workflow continuity

5. **Production Deployment**
   - Set up production environment
   - Implement security measures
   - Create operational procedures

## Conclusion

The research and documentation provide a solid foundation for implementing a comprehensive Claude Code agent system. The BMAD-METHOD offers proven patterns for agent coordination, while the extended research addresses the specific needs of a solo developer working with Claude Code. With clear implementation guidelines and detailed specifications, the project is ready to move from planning to execution.
