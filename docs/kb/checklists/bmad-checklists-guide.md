## When Each Checklist Should Be Used

### Development Lifecycle Flow

```
Product Definition → Architecture → Planning → Development → Change Management
       ↓                 ↓            ↓           ↓              ↓
  PM Checklist    Architect      PO Master    Story Draft   Change Checklist
                  Checklist      Checklist    & Story DoD
```

### Phase-Specific Usage

#### 1. **Product Definition Phase**
- **PM Checklist**: Used iteratively as PRD is developed and refined
- Ensures completeness before architecture phase

#### 2. **Architecture Phase**
- **Architect Checklist**: Applied after PRD approval

#### 3. **Planning Phase**
- **PO Master Checklist**: Validates overall project plan
- **Story Draft Checklist**: Applied to each story before assignment

#### 4. **Development Phase**
- **Story DoD Checklist**: Used by developers for self-validation
- Applied before marking stories complete

#### 5. **Change Management**
- **Change Checklist**: Triggered by significant issues or changes
- Can occur at any phase when problems arise

## How Checklists Ensure Quality

### 1. **Comprehensive Coverage**
Each checklist addresses all critical aspects of its domain, preventing oversight of important considerations. They include embedded instructions for AI agents to ensure thorough analysis.

### 2. **Risk Mitigation**
Checklists identify potential risks early:
- Technical feasibility issues
- Integration challenges
- Scope creep
- Missing requirements
- Dependency conflicts

### 3. **Consistency Enforcement**
- Standardized validation across all projects
- Consistent quality regardless of agent or team
- Repeatable processes for similar project types

### 4. **Adaptive Intelligence**
Checklists adapt based on:
- Project type (greenfield vs brownfield)
- Presence of UI/UX components
- Technical complexity
- Integration requirements

### 5. **Clear Decision Gates**
Each checklist provides:
