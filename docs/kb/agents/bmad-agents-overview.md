## Agent Architecture Overview

The BMAD-METHOD uses a sophisticated agent-based architecture where each agent:
- Has a specific persona and role in the software development lifecycle
- Contains embedded YAML configuration defining their behavior
- Can be activated through the orchestrator or directly
- Has access to specific tasks, templates, checklists, and data resources
- Follows strict activation and interaction protocols

### Common Agent Features
- **Activation Protocol**: All agents follow a 3-step activation process
- **Command System**: Commands require `*` prefix (e.g., `*help`)
- **Dynamic Resource Loading**: Resources are loaded only when needed, not pre-loaded
- **Numbered Options**: All choices are presented as numbered lists
- **Character Consistency**: Agents maintain their persona throughout interactions
