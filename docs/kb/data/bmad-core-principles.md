# BMAD Core Principles and Methodologies

## Overview

BMad-Method (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-driven Development) is a framework that combines AI agents with Agile development methodologies. The v4 system introduces a modular architecture with improved dependency management, bundle optimization, and support for both web and IDE environments.

## Core Philosophy

### Vibe CEO'ing

You are the "Vibe CEO" - thinking like a CEO with unlimited resources and a singular vision. Your AI agents are your high-powered team, and your role is to:

- **Direct**: Provide clear instructions and objectives
- **Refine**: Iterate on outputs to achieve quality
- **Oversee**: Maintain strategic alignment across all agents

### Core Principles

1. **MAXIMIZE_AI_LEVERAGE**: Push the AI to deliver more. Challenge outputs and iterate.
2. **QUALITY_CONTROL**: You are the ultimate arbiter of quality. Review all outputs.
3. **STRATEGIC_OVERSIGHT**: Maintain the high-level vision and ensure alignment.
4. **ITERATIVE_REFINEMENT**: Expect to revisit steps. This is not a linear process.
5. **CLEAR_INSTRUCTIONS**: Precise requests lead to better outputs.
6. **DOCUMENTATION_IS_KEY**: Good inputs (briefs, PRDs) lead to good outputs.
7. **START_SMALL_SCALE_FAST**: Test concepts, then expand.
8. **EMBRACE_THE_CHAOS**: Adapt and overcome challenges.

### Key Workflow Principles

1. **Agent Specialization**: Each agent has specific expertise and responsibilities
2. **Clean Handoffs**: Always start fresh when switching between agents
3. **Status Tracking**: Maintain story statuses (Draft → Approved → InProgress → Done)
4. **Iterative Development**: Complete one story before starting the next
5. **Documentation First**: Always start with solid PRD and architecture

## The Core Method

BMad transforms you into a "Vibe CEO" - directing a team of specialized AI agents through structured workflows. Here's how:

1. **You Direct, AI Executes**: You provide vision and decisions; agents handle implementation details
2. **Specialized Agents**: Each agent masters one role (PM, Developer, Architect, etc.)
3. **Structured Workflows**: Proven patterns guide you from idea to deployed code
4. **Clean Handoffs**: Fresh context windows ensure agents stay focused and effective

## The Two-Phase Approach

### Phase 1: Planning (Web UI - Cost Effective)

- Use large context windows (Gemini's 1M tokens)
- Generate comprehensive documents (PRD, Architecture)
- Leverage multiple agents for brainstorming
- Create once, use throughout development

### Phase 2: Development (IDE - Implementation)

- Shard documents into manageable pieces
- Execute focused SM → Dev cycles
- One story at a time, sequential progress
- Real-time file operations and testing

## The Development Loop

```text
1. SM Agent (New Chat) → Creates next story from sharded docs
2. You → Review and approve story
3. Dev Agent (New Chat) → Implements approved story
4. QA Agent (New Chat) → Reviews and refactors code
5. You → Verify completion
6. Repeat until epic complete
```

## Why This Works

- **Context Optimization**: Clean chats = better AI performance
- **Role Clarity**: Agents don't context-switch = higher quality
- **Incremental Progress**: Small stories = manageable complexity
- **Human Oversight**: You validate each step = quality control
- **Document-Driven**: Specs guide everything = consistency

## Contributing Core Principles

(from docs/GUIDING-PRINCIPLES.md):

- **Dev Agents Must Be Lean**: Minimize dependencies, save context for code
- **Natural Language First**: Everything in markdown, no code in core
- **Core vs Expansion Packs**: Core for universal needs, packs for specialized domains
- **Design Philosophy**: "Dev agents code, planning agents plan"

## When to Use BMad

- **New Projects (Greenfield)**: Complete end-to-end development
- **Existing Projects (Brownfield)**: Feature additions and enhancements
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple roles working together
- **Quality Assurance**: Structured testing and validation
- **Documentation**: Professional PRDs, architecture docs, user stories
