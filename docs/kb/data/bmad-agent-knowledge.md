## Agent Interaction Commands

### IDE-Specific Syntax

**Agent Loading by IDE**:

- **Claude Code**: `/agent-name` (e.g., `/bmad-master`)
- **Cursor**: `@agent-name` (e.g., `@bmad-master`)
- **Windsurf**: `@agent-name` (e.g., `@bmad-master`)
- **Trae**: `@agent-name` (e.g., `@bmad-master`)
- **Roo Code**: Select mode from mode selector (e.g., `bmad-master`)
- **GitHub Copilot**: Open the Chat view (`⌃⌘I` on Mac, `Ctrl+Alt+I` on Windows/Linux) and select **Agent** from the chat mode selector.

**Chat Management Guidelines**:

- **Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Trae**: Start new chats when switching agents
- **Roo Code**: Switch modes within the same conversation

**Common Task Commands**:

- `*help` - Show available commands
- `*status` - Show current context/progress
- `*exit` - Exit the agent mode
- `*shard-doc docs/prd.md prd` - Shard PRD into manageable pieces
- `*shard-doc docs/architecture.md architecture` - Shard architecture document
- `*create` - Run create-next-story task (SM agent)

**In Web UI**:

```text
/pm create-doc prd
/architect review system design
/dev implement story 1.2
/help - Show available commands
/switch agent-name - Change active agent (if orchestrator available)
```

## Getting Started

### Quick Start Options

#### Option 1: Web UI

**Best for**: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini users who want to start immediately

1. Navigate to `dist/teams/`
2. Copy `team-fullstack.txt` content
3. Create new Gemini Gem or CustomGPT
4. Upload file with instructions: "Your critical operating instructions are attached, do not break character as directed"
5. Type `/help` to see available commands

#### Option 2: IDE Integration

**Best for**: Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Trae, Cline, Roo Code, Github Copilot users

```bash
# Interactive installation (recommended)
npx bmad-method install
```

**Installation Steps**:

- Choose "Complete installation"
- Select your IDE from supported options:
