# Improvement Stories - Phase 2.5

## Overview
Based on actionable insights from Gemini research and Phase 1/2 implementation experience, these improvement stories focus on enhancing the already-implemented Claude Code Agent System.

## High Priority Improvements

### IMP-001: Context Summarization for Token Management
- **Goal**: Prevent performance degradation after 2-hour sessions
- **Approach**: Automatic context compression at 80% threshold
- **Impact**: Extended session duration, better performance

### IMP-002: JSON Schema Validation for Agent Configuration
- **Goal**: Prevent runtime errors from invalid configurations
- **Approach**: Schema registry with compile-time validation
- **Impact**: Better developer experience, fewer errors

### IMP-003: Enhanced Story File Generation
- **Goal**: Provide richer context in story files
- **Approach**: Include technical context, dependencies, test scenarios
- **Impact**: Improved developer productivity

### IMP-005: Agent Safety Constraints and Guardrails
- **Goal**: Ensure safe agent operations in production
- **Approach**: Resource limits, action constraints, monitoring
- **Impact**: Production-ready safety

## Medium Priority Improvements

### IMP-004: Advanced Workflow Patterns
- **Goal**: Support sophisticated multi-agent coordination
- **Approach**: Implement Orchestrator-Workers, Router, Pipeline patterns
- **Impact**: Better handling of complex workflows

### IMP-006: Graph-Based Context Relationships
- **Goal**: Enable efficient context navigation and impact analysis
- **Approach**: Build relationship graph with traversal capabilities
- **Impact**: Better context understanding and management

## Next Steps
1. Begin with high-priority improvements (IMP-001, IMP-002, IMP-003, IMP-005)
2. Measure performance improvements after each implementation
3. Proceed with medium-priority improvements
4. Update project tracker as improvements are completed
