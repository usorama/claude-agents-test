# Claude Code Agent System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Create a comprehensive Claude Code agent system that ports all BMAD-METHOD agents to Claude Code's tool ecosystem
- Extend agent capabilities with specialized agents for context management, UI/UX architecture, CI/CD, Git management, monitoring, and self-healing
- Enable non-stop development workflows through Tmux orchestration integration
- Implement intelligent agent coordination with parallel task execution capabilities
- Establish robust context management through JSON/YAML for seamless inter-agent communication
- Build a complete solo-developer assistant system covering the entire product lifecycle from planning to operations

### Background Context
The BMAD-METHOD provides a proven framework for AI-driven agile development through specialized agents working in coordinated workflows. This project aims to adapt and extend BMAD's approach specifically for Claude Code, leveraging its unique tool ecosystem while adding critical capabilities needed for solo developers. The system will enable continuous, autonomous development with minimal human intervention while maintaining high quality standards and self-healing capabilities.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The Claude Code Agent System will provide a command-line interface experience where developers interact with specialized agents through natural language commands. The system emphasizes clarity, efficiency, and intelligent automation while maintaining transparency in agent activities.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- Natural language communication with agents using slash commands (e.g., `/analyst`, `/dev`, `/orchestrator`)
- Visual feedback through terminal output showing agent activities and progress
- Persistent tmux sessions for continuous development visibility
- Structured file outputs for all agent deliverables
- Interactive prompts for critical decisions and clarifications

### Core Screens and Views
- Orchestrator Dashboard (tmux main view)
- Agent Activity Monitor (tmux panes)
- Context Manager State Viewer
- Workflow Progress Tracker
- Error and Alert Display

### Accessibility: None

### Branding
Claude Code native experience with consistent formatting and output styles matching the existing Claude Code interface paradigms.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

## Known Constraints and Limitations

### Claude Code Tool Limitations
- No network access (cannot make HTTP requests or access external APIs)
- No database connections (must use file-based storage)
- No background processes (all operations are synchronous)
- No container/Docker management capabilities
- Limited to file system operations and command execution

### Performance Constraints
- Known performance degradation after ~5 hours of continuous use
- Token limits per conversation (requires periodic context reset)
- Sequential processing only (no true parallel execution)
- File I/O bottlenecks with large context files

### Cost Considerations
- High token usage with multi-agent systems
- Costs scale linearly with agent interactions
- No cost optimization features built into Claude Code
- Requires external monitoring and budgeting

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

### Service Architecture
The system will use a modular agent architecture within a monorepo structure. Each agent will be implemented as a separate module with shared utilities and context management infrastructure.

### Testing Requirements
Comprehensive testing pyramid including unit tests for agent logic, integration tests for inter-agent communication, and end-to-end tests for complete workflows. Manual testing convenience methods for agent prompt validation.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- Claude Code as the primary AI platform with access to all native tools
- File-based persistence for context and state management
- YAML/JSON as primary data exchange formats
- Tmux for session management and visualization
- Git for version control integration
- Markdown for all documentation outputs
- Structured logging for all agent activities
- Event-driven communication between agents where applicable
