## Notes and Observations

- The file-based architecture is a significant constraint but workable
- Performance degradation is the highest risk to monitor - context summarization (IMP-001) is critical
- Cost management must be built in from the start
- User expectations must be carefully managed
- Success depends on working within Claude Code's limitations, not against them
- **Phase 1 & 2 Success**: All 9 core agents successfully implemented and tested
- **Key Learning**: Context management and agent coordination working well with file-based approach
- **Priority Focus**: Performance improvements to extend session duration beyond 2 hours
- **Research Insights**: Gemini research provided valuable optimization strategies
